# Project-2-Game
Welcome to Ghost Mansion! 
Made by Mason and Dom

To play, use the arrow keys to move. Collect all the coins to win, and avoid the spikes. 
Overall, making this game was a fun, but very challenging experience. One issue with the game that we weren't able to figure out in time was how to get the player and enemy locations to reset when resetting the game. It only works if you actually refresh the page, where just pressing 'R' to reset will have the player and enemies in the same place, and therefore, you would just keep dying on loop. Because of this, it's better to just refresh the page if you want to play again.
